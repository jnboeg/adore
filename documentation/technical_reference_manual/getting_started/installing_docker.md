# Installing Docker 

The ADORe build system sometimes uses experimental features of docker. 
For this reason it is important to have a recent version of docker installed. 
Using "apt-get" or "apt" to install Docker is not sufficient. Software packages
within the Ubuntu central repositories are always very old.

> **⚠️  WARNING:**
> ADORe depends on docker compose >= v2. If you do not have docker compose >= v2
> installed your build will fail. The command line tool `docker-compose` was
> renamed to `docker compose`. Install the latest docker to resolve this issue.

## Installing Docker: Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 and 24.04
To install the latest version of docker in Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04 and 24.04 you can follow
the official Docker document at: [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ 🔗](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

Alternatively, ADORe provides a shell script that you can use to install the latest Docker. 
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DLR-TS/adore_tools/master/tools/install_docker.sh | bash -
```
Follow the prompts until the installation completes. Once complete you should be greeted with something such as this:
```text
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

> **⚠️  WARNING:**
> As a general rule you should never run shell scripts from untrusted sources. 


> **ℹ️ INFO:**
> After installing Docker you may need to log out and log back in to make group changes take effect.</p>

### Verifying your Docker group
In order for you to be able to run any docker commands your current user must
be a member of the docker group. This occurs during installation but will not 
take effect until you log out and log back in again. To verify you are a member
of the docker group run: `id | sed "s|,|\n|g" | grep docker`

Which should yield something similar to:
```bash
998(docker)
```

### Verifying your docker installation
At any time you can verify your docker installation by running the docker hello
world image with the following:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
Which will yield:
```bash
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```
